### Stable branch
Introducing a new versioning scheme to openHABian. Please welcome `stable` branch.
Similar to openHAB where there's releases and snapshots, you will from now on be using the stable branch. It's the equivalent of an openHAB release.
We will keep providing new changes to the master branch first as soon as we make them available, just like we have been doing in the past. If you want to keep living on the edge, want to make use of new features fast or volunteer to help a little in advancing openHABian, you can choose to switch back to the master branch.
Anybody else will benefit from less frequent but well better tested updates to happen to the stable branch in batches, whenever the poor daring people to use `master` have reported their trust in these changes to work flawlessly.
You can switch branches at any time using the menu option 01.

### Supported hardware and Operating Systems
openHABian now fully supports all Raspberry Pi SBCs with our fast-start image. As an add-on package, it is supposed to run on all Debian based OSs.

Check the [README](#README.md) to see what "supported" actually means and what you can do if you want to run on other HW or OS.

### ZRAM per default
Swap, logs and persistence files are now put into ZRAM per default.
See [ZRAM status thread](https://community.openhab.org/t/zram-status/80996) for more information.

### New Java options
Preparing for openHAB 3, new options for the JDK that runs openHAB are now available:

 - Java Zulu 8 32-Bit OpenJDK (default on ARM based platforms)
 - Java Zulu 8 64-Bit OpenJDK (default on x86 based platforms)
 - Java Zulu 11 32-Bit OpenJDK (beta testing)
 - Java Zulu 11 64-Bit OpenJDK (beta testing)
 - AdoptOpenJDK 11 OpenJDK (beta replacement for Zulu)

openHAB 3 will be Java 11 only.  2.5.X is supposed to work on both, Java 8 and Java 11.
Running the current openHAB on Java 11 however has not been tested on a wide scale.

Please participate in beta testing to help create a smooth transition user experience for all of us.
See [announcement thread](https://community.openhab.org/t/Java-testdrive/99827) on the community forum.
