# openHABian - Hassle-free openHAB Setup

The Raspberry Pi and other small single-board computers are quite famous platforms for openHAB.
However, setting up a fully working Linux system with all recommended packages and openHAB recommendations is a **boring task** taking quite some time and **Linux newcomers** shouldn't worry about these technical details.

***A home automation enthusiast doesn't have to be a Linux enthusiast!***

openHABian aims to provide a **self-configuring** Linux system setup specific to the needs of every openHAB user.
The project provides two things:

* A set of scripts to set up openHAB on any Debian/Ubuntu based system
* Complete **SD-card images pre-configured with openHAB** and many other openHAB- and Hardware-specific preparations, namely for the Raspberry Pi.
