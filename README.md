# openHABian - Hassle-free openHAB Setup

Setting up a fully working Linux system with all needed packages and openHAB recommendations is a **boring task** taking quite some time and **Linux newcomers** shouldn't worry about these technical details.

***A home automation enthusiast doesn't have to be a Linux enthusiast!***

openHABian aims to provide a **self-configuring** Linux system setup specific to the needs of every openHAB user.
The project provides two things:

*   a set of scripts to set up openHAB on any Debian based system (Raspbian, Ubuntu)
*   a complete **SD-card image pre-configured with openHAB** and many other openHAB- and Hardware-specific preparations for all *Raspberry Pi* models.

## Hardware and OS support
As of openHABian version 1.5 of the image, all Raspberry Pi models are supported as hardware.
Anything x86 based may work or not. Anything else ARM based such as ODroids, OrangePis and the like may work or not.
NAS servers such as QNAP and Synology boxes will not work. Support for PINEA64 was also dropped in this current release.
We strongly recommend that users choose Raspberry Pi 2, 3 or 4 systems to have 1GB of RAM or more. RPi 1 and 0/0W only have a single CPU core and 512MB. This can be sufficient to run a smallish openHAB setup, but it will not be enough to run a full-blown system with many bindings and memory consuming openHABian features/components such as ZRAM, InfluxDB or Grafana.
We do not actively prohibit installation on any hardware - including unsupported systems -, but we might skip or deny to install specific extensions such as those memory hungry features named above.
Supporting hardware means testing every single patch and every release. There are simply too many SBC and HW combinations that maintainers do not have available, or, even if they did, the time to spend on the testing efforts that is required to make openHABian a reliable system.
Let's make sure you understand the implications of these statements: it means that to run hardware other than RPi 2/3/4 or x86 is **not** _fully_ supported.
For ARM hardware that we don't support, check out the [fake hardware parameters](openhabian.md/#fake-hardware-mode).
There's a good chance it'll work out for you. If that still doesn't work for you, give [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/iot) or [ARMbian](https://www.armbian.com/) a try.
But remember if you hit any problem related to memory or hardware, you'll be on your own. You are expected **not** to raise these problems as issues on the community forum or on GitHub, please. Feel encouraged to report any success stories, though.

Going beyond what the RPi image provides, as a manually installed set of scripts, there's a fair chance that openHABian will work on all Debian like Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, on either ARM or x86 hardware, but remember this is not _supported_.

Our recommendation is to install Raspbian lite (ARM) or generic Debian (x86). This is what we support and test openHABian against.

If you choose not to use the image, we expect you to use the stable distribution that openHABian testing is based on, 'buster' for Raspbian (ARM) and Debian (x86) that is.
To install openHABian on anything older or newer may work or not. If you encounter issues, you may need to upgrade first or to live with the consequences of running an OS on the edge of software development.

Either way, please note that you're on your own when it comes to configuring and installing the HW with the proper OS yourself.

### 64 bit ?
Although RPi3 and 4 have a 64 bit processor, you cannot run openHAB in 64 bit.
The Azul Java Virtual Machine we currently use is incompatible with the aarch64 ARM architecture.
In general you should be aware that to run in 64 bit has a major drawback, increased memory usage, that is not a good idea on a heavily memory constrained platform like a RPi.
Also remember openHABian makes use of Raspbian which today still is a 32 bit OS.

We are closely observing development and will adapt openHABian once it will reliably work on 64 bit.
So things may change in the future, but for the time being, you should not manually enforce to install a 64 bit JVM.

On x86 hardware, 64 bit is the standard.

## Installation and Setup
Please check the [official documentation article](https://www.openhab.org/docs/installation/openhabian.html) to learn about openHABian and please visit and subscribe to our very active [community forum thread](https://community.openhab.org/t/13379).

If you want to install openHABian on non-supported hardware, you can actually fake it to make openHABian treat your box as if it was one of the supported ones. Needless to say that that may work out or not, but it's worth a try.
See [openhabian](openhabian.md) how to edit openhabian.conf before booting. Set the hw, hwarch and release parameters to match your system best.

## Development
openHABian is foremost a collection of `bash` scripts versioned and deployed using git. In the current state the scripts can only be invoked through the terminal menu system [whiptail](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting/Whiptail). There is a longterm need to better separate the UI part from the script code. A work has started to define conventions and further explain the code base in the document [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) along with development guidelines in general.

A good place to look at to start to understand the code is the file `openhabian-setup.sh`.

### Building Hardware Images
Take a look at the `build.bash` script to get an idea of the process.
Simply explained run the code below with `platform` being either `rpi` or `pine64`. The RPi image is based on the [Raspbian Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian) standard image while the Pine64 image is based on [build-pine64-image](https://github.com/longsleep/build-pine64-image).
```
$ sudo bash ./build.bash platform
```
As the script uses `openhab/openhabian` git repository during installation it must sometimes be changed to test code from other repositories, like a new feature in a fork. There are two commands for replacing the git repo with a custom one. The first command uses the current checked-out repository used in the filesystem:
```
$ sudo bash build.bash platform dev-git
```
The second command uses a fully customizable repository:
```
$ sudo bash build.bash platform dev-url branch url
```

### Testing
Testing is done continuously with Travis using the test framework [Bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and the linter [Shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/).  As the tests focus on installing software, a docker solution is used for easy build-up and teardown. To run the test suite execute the commands below or `"$ ./test.bash docker-full"`. Docker and Shellcheck need to be installed. For more details regarding the tests see [Test Architecture](https://github.com/openhab/openhabian/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#test-architecture) in CONTRIBUTING.

```
docker build -t openhabian/openhabian-bats .
docker run -i openhabian/openhabian-bats bash -c 'bats -r -f "unit-." .'

docker run --name "install-test" --privileged -d openhabian/openhabian-bats
docker exec -i install-test bash -c "./build.bash local-test && mv ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile && /etc/rc.local"                                                
docker exec -i install-test bash -c 'bats -r -f "installation-." .'
docker exec -i install-test bash -c 'bats -r -f "destructive-." .'

docker stop install-test
docker rm install-test
```
Run the linter by executing:
```
shellcheck -x -s bash openhabian-setup.sh
shellcheck -x -s bash functions/*.bash
shellcheck -x -s bash build-image/*.bash
```


Happy Hacking!
